# Nature Buddy App

#### Hi! My name's Phil and this github repo will be where I'll be storing my HTML, CSS and Javascript code for my Nature Buddy App!

## What is Nature Buddy?

This app is for people who want to explore Singapore's Nature and has no idea where to start. 

The app will provide a suggestion by grabbing from a list of Parks, Nature Reserves and other Natural points of interests and then provide directions to said Location. App will then allow users to track their "Adventure" and once they are done, swiping up will allow users to see a trip summary displaying the total time taken and also their total distance travelled. 

Under the summary, users will also see a small tree which will grow for every time that they go on a adventure, providing users with a sense of progress/achievement. The app will also award badges for more significant achievements such as "Taken 3 Adventures!" or "Walked a total of 10km".
